# Dockerized skeleton SvelteKit project

### Just a `basic SvelteKit` project with `Docker`.

I was trying learn about `SvelteKit` and needed some upgrade & update for `node` and `npm` in my PC. I also started learing about `Docker` at that time as I wanted to try something new for my development setup, with one command line to start, and I tried on this projects. I know there's not much twist or tweak but if you want to start your `SvelteKit` learning quick, clone the repo and have fun.

## Starting the project

run the following command

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Go to: `http://localhost:5173/`
